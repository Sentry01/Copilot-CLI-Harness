**Status**: Placeholder - needs to be created

**How to create**:
1. Run the harness on a sample project
2. Use a screen recorder (e.g., `asciinema`, `ttygif`, or QuickTime on macOS)
3. Capture ~30 seconds showing:
   - Harness starting up
   - Feature verification in progress
   - Progress counter incrementing
4. Convert to GIF and save as `demo.gif`

**Recommended tools**:
- `asciinema` + `svg-term-cli` for terminal recordings
- `gifski` for high-quality GIF conversion
- Keep file size under 5MB for fast loading
